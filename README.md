This makes your mech and cores have ALOT of health (Works well with my OverPowered-EX-Mod) so you'll be almost unkillable. Some things can kill you like standing in the spawn radius of the enemies.
Everytime when you enter a game you can die as you have around 1 hp. Once you get killed and repsawn then you will have all your health (GodMode Enabled).
